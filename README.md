# _betaDateCalculator

Same functionality as the original Date Calculator.  But the field titles are updated.

Since the original is a built-in, it can't get enough exposure to evolve.  A beta cycle as an add-on may help.   

## The Add-on still needs some love
* 'Result' generated should respenct the date format preferences (regardless of Preferences, the output format is yyyy-mm-dd )
* the box sizes for the 2 expressions should not scale.  They should be fixed at 2 or 3 rows.
* a button to copy the results to OS clipboard would speed up workflow
* button to grab the date from the active event or citation
* a today button
* ability to interpret latin in Expression 2 ([instante](https://gramps-project.org/wiki/index.php/Genealogy_Glossary#inst)/inst/in≈øt , [proximo](https://gramps-project.org/wiki/index.php/Genealogy_Glossary#prox)/prox or
[ultimo](https://gramps-project.org/wiki/index.php/Genealogy_Glossary#ult)/ult )
* calculate based of day of week references. e.g., last Tuesday, Tuesday week, a week Tuesday.
